We feel deeply grateful and appreciated. Now that the long process of acquiring the pharmacy is finally done, we are very excited at the prospect of bringing the best products and services for healing and health that we can find. We live in a fortunate time when many new and more effective medicines and therapies are becoming available, from alternative as well as traditional sources. We are committed to bringing some of the best among them to you. And we would like to ask for your help.\r\n\r\nPlease send us suggestions on which products or services you would like us to carry, or how we may do things differently to serve you better. Suggestions can be e-mailed to us at zsu@wm-rx.com, or put in the suggestions box at the pharmacy.
